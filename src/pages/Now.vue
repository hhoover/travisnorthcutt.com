    <h3>April 2020 update, pandemic edition:</h3>
    <p>
      Work: I am currently doing contract development for a few clients, mostly
      focused on Laravel and VueJS. If you need this kind of help, get in touch.
      <a href="https://travisnorthcutt.com/work-with-me/">More on that here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Pandemic: pretty crazy, huh? Our family is mostly weathering the weirdness
      ok; we already worked from home so that wasn’t an adjustment, and
      thankfully my work hasn’t been impacted (yet?). The biggest change is
      having Kyle at home 24/7, but he’s doing amazingly well with that. For now
      he’s still doing school stuff and spends lots of time on video chats with
      his classmates, both goofing off and collaborating on school work. I’m
      thankful that we’re not more impacted by the craziness.
    </p>
    <h3>June 2019 update:</h3>
    <p>
      A year in, we love living in Fort Collins. Lots of new friends, we’ve been
      biking a ton, exploring the area, etc. etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      For work right now, I’m focused on
      <a href="https://pluginpro.dev">Plugin Pro</a>, a service I launched to
      manage WordPress plugin development for SaaS companies. Amanda and I are
      also working on what could be a rather large and interesting project with
      a large organization here. It’s too early to tell if that’ll get off the
      ground, but we’ll see.
    </p>
    <h3>June 2018 update:</h3>
    <p>
      Oh, snap! We’re settled in Fort Collins in our new house. I have a home
      office, which is amazing after two years of working from coffee
      shops/AirBnBs/trains/planes/automobiles (no, really). Kyle is
      making&nbsp;<em>tons</em> of friends in our neighborhood, and everyone has
      been very friendly and welcoming. We’ve found a church we like, and are
      making friends there. The hiking and biking here is great, and we’ve been
      taking full advantage of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Business:&nbsp;</strong>things are going well with our
      <a href="http://memberup.co/services">consulting practice</a>; we’re
      working with interesting clients from (literally) around the world.
    </p>
    <h3>April 2018 update:</h3>
    <p>
      We’re in the process (closing in a few days) of buying a house in Fort
      Collins, Colorado. We spent the month of March there looking for houses,
      settling on a school for Kyle, and making friends, and it already feels
      like home.
    </p>
    <p>If&nbsp; you’re in Fort Collins or nearby, shoot me a message.</p>
    <h3>December 2017 update:</h3>
    <p>
      After nearly two years of full time travel, we’re planning on settling
      down in 2018… we just don’t know where yet! We’ve got a few cities
      (Asheville, Chattanooga, Fort Collins, and Colorado Springs) on the list
      to check out in January, and if one of those feels right to us, we’ll plan
      a longer stay in the spring to really test it out.
    </p>
    <h3>November 2016 update:</h3>
    <p>
      We sold our house in&nbsp;April and have been traveling full time since
      then. Nomads, gypsies, whatever you want to call us is fine with me ;).
      It’s been quite an adventure; more on that at our family site:

    </p>
    <p>Everything else below&nbsp;is still accurate.</p>
    <h3>December 2015 update:</h3>
    <p>
      Amanda, Kyle, and I are selling our house in Texas in a few months (Spring
      of 2016), and will be fullish-time nomads for a while!&nbsp;If you know me
      well,&nbsp;email/tweet/carrier-pigeon me for more details.
